# Intro to Web Debugging Workshop (cmd-f Learn 2021) ðŸŒ±

Hello friends! This workshop was presented at cmd-f Learn 2021 - the Youtube recording can be found [here](https://youtu.be/fhxKmcvNSkE) and the full workshop content can be found on Notion [here](https://tinyurl.com/debuggingworkshop) âœ¨

Sometimes you're building something super cool, you're confident it works, but something looks just a little bit... off? Finding mistakes and debugging issues in your code is a skill that can take time to master, and this workshop will help walk you through some tips and tricks to start debugging a portfolio and Studio Ghibli website!

Building up a base intuition for debugging is a super important skill to have, whether working on a personal project or contributing to a new codebase at an internship!
